TheraMind AI is a multilingual, web-based therapeutic assistance platform that I have been independently developing to explore how conversational systems can support people who face financial, geographic, or language barriers to traditional mental-health care. Rather than replacing therapy, the platform serves as an experimental environment for reflective conversation and guided self-dialogue. It combines full-stack development with interaction design and language modeling: conversations are stored as structured session states, allowing emotional continuity instead of isolated message exchange. A key component of the system is Dr. Dee, a non-typical “tough-love” counselor persona designed for users who benefit from direct, provocative motivation delivered safely and ethically. The platform supports 15 languages with automatic detection, translation, and speech features, aiming to preserve emotional nuance across cultures. Through continuous redesign, debugging, and refinement, TheraMind has become both a technical project and an inquiry into how computational structure, language, and human experience interact.
